Raspberry Pi Pico Control Board
I took the info from https://github.com/FeralAI/GP2040 and decided to make my own board because it looked fun.

# features
So it has all the features software features as the Pico Fighting Board. It has support for the RGB LED but I don't have one so I haven't put it on my board.

# releases
Head over to https://github.com/FeralAI/GP2040/releases and use **GP2040-PicoFightingBoard_v0.4.3.uf2** leave everything as default and it'll work
