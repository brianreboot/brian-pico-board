Raspberry Pi Pico Control Board
I took the info from https://github.com/FeralAI/GP2040 and decided to make my own board because it looked fun.

# features
So it has all the features software features as the Pico Fighting Board. It has support for the RGB LED but I don't have one so I haven't put it on my board.
