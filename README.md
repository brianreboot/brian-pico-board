# Brian's Pico Board rev.2
This is a Raspberry Pi Pico Control Board. <br />
I took the info from https://github.com/FeralAI/GP2040 and decided to make my own board because it looked fun. For more details go there.

# Software features
So it has all the features software features as the Pico Fighting Board. It has support for the RGB LED but I don't have one so I haven't put it on my board.

# Physical features
I made this board as small as possible but big enough to made it easy enough for anyone with a standard soldering iron to make it. Which is why I went with through hole resistors because they're easier to solder and I have a bunch of them that I want to get rid of. <br />
The 20-pin uses the ![Brook Fighting Board Cable](https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/59387342/)
