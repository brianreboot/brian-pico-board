This is a Raspberry Pi Pico Control Board
I took the info from https://github.com/FeralAI/GP2040 and decided to make my own board because it looked fun. For more details go there.

So it has all the features software features as the Pico Fighting Board. It has support for the RGB LED but I don't have one so I haven't put it on my board.
