# Specs
You're going to need two 4.7K Ohm pull-up resisters for the OLED. The 20-pin connectors is for the Brook harness.

# Getting the PCB made.

# Firmware
Go to the [Open Stick Foundation Github](https://github.com/OpenStickFoundation/GP2040-CE) for more info and firmware. <br />

Alternatively if you're using the HRAP Premium VLX controller which has a different button mapping then visit my github <https://github.com/brianreboot/GP2040-CE> and check out the VLX tree for the tweaked firmware. It has the same functionality except that the button layout on the OLED has been modified to match.
